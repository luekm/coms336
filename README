The easiest way I've found to run this code and interact with the graphics is to use a dedicated server preview tool within VSCode.

Namely the extension: "Live Preview" made by Microsoft.   

You can additionally host your own server and run it but the extension is much easier.

The various hw folders contain different problems, to view the graphics, go to the html file
and use the live preview button in the top right of VSCode.
    
HW6 is the final project.
